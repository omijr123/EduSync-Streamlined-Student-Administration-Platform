Here it is an PHP, Mysql, Html, Css, Javascript & Xampp based project. In 2nd year 2nd semester in DBMS LAB course I made this project with my classmates. 

Below given the detailed description about the project:

Project Name: “EduSync: Streamlined Student Administration Platform”

Introduction:

EduSync: Streamlined Student Administration Platform is designed to streamline the administrative tasks and provide a unified interface for students, faculty, parents, and administrators within an educational institution. The purpose of this project is to simplify the process of managing academic and administrative tasks, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the institution's operations. EduSync aims to improve the current system, making it more accessible and efficient for all users. This platform will enable better communication, data management, and reporting capabilities.

Summary:

The EduSync project aims to develop an integrated educational management system designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of academic and administrative tasks within an educational institution. The system provides distinct dashboards and functionalities tailored for students, faculty, parents, and administrators, each addressing their specific needs and roles.

Students: Upon logging in, students are directed to their personalized dashboard, where they can access detailed information about their courses, view their marks for various exams and assignments, check their attendance records, and stay updated with the latest institutional notices. Additionally, students can view attendance records for all courses in their department and check attendance for any course on a particular date.

Faculty: Faculty members have a dedicated dashboard that allows them to manage their teaching responsibilities efficiently. They can take attendance for their courses, update pre-existing attendance records, and input marks for student exams and assignments. Faculty members can also add new courses with detailed descriptions and schedules according to their preferences. Furthermore, they can view important notices announced by the administrator.

Parents: Parents are provided with a dashboard where they can monitor their children’s academic and attendance performance. They can view detailed attendance records, including the total number of classes for a course and the attendance percentage. Parents can also see their children's marks and the highest marks for course exams, stay informed with the latest announcements, and visualize and download statistical data of their child’s academic and attendance performance.

Admins: Administrators have the most comprehensive set of functionalities to manage the institution's operations. From their dashboard, admins can add, update, and delete courses, create and remove departments, and manage notices by adding, deleting, and viewing all notices. They can generate detailed reports and statistical analyses based on the available data, providing valuable insights into the institution's performance. Admins also have access to detailed performance/pattern metrics for individual students and faculty members, enabling them to make informed decisions.
