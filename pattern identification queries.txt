Pattern Identification Queries:
 1. Attendance Patterns by Day of the Week:
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(attendance_date) AS Day, AVG(Status = 'Present') AS Average_Attendance
FROM attendance
GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(attendance_date)
ORDER BY Average
2. Average Marks by Semester
SELECT e.Semester, AVG(m.Obtained_Marks) AS Average_Marks
FROM marks m
JOIN enrollment_status e ON m.Student_ID = e.Student_ID AND m.Course_ID = e.Course_ID
GROUP BY e.Semester
ORDER BY e.Semester;
3. Faculty Activity Patterns
SELECT c.course_faculty_id AS Faculty_ID, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Submissions
FROM marks m
JOIN courses c ON m.Course_ID = c.Course_ID
GROUP BY c.course_faculty_id
ORDER BY Number_of_Submissions DESC;
4. Student Average Attendance Patterns
SELECT s.Student_Name, AVG(a.Status = 'Present') AS Average_Attendance
FROM attendance a
JOIN students s ON a.Student_ID = s.Student_ID
GROUP BY s.Student_Name
ORDER BY s.Student_Name;
5. Department Popularity
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(s.Student_ID) AS Student_Count
FROM department d
JOIN students s ON d.department_id = s.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
ORDER BY Student_Count DESC;
6. Average Marks Distribution by Course
SELECT c.Course_Name, AVG(m.Obtained_Marks) AS Average_Marks
FROM marks m
JOIN courses c ON m.Course_ID = c.Course_ID
GROUP BY c.Course_Name
ORDER BY c.Course_Name;
7. Department Performance
SELECT d.department_name, AVG(m.Obtained_Marks) AS Average_Marks
FROM marks m
JOIN students s ON m.Student_ID = s.Student_ID
JOIN department d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
ORDER BY Average_Marks DESC;
8. Exam Performance by Type
SELECT et.Exam_Type_Name, AVG(m.Obtained_Marks) AS Average_Marks
FROM marks m
JOIN examinations e ON m.Exam_ID = e.Exam_ID
JOIN exam_types et ON e.Exam_Type_ID = et.Exam_Type_ID
GROUP BY et.Exam_Type_Name
ORDER BY Average_Marks DESC;
